# Reinforcement Learning Academy

This is a repository for **Reinforcement Learning Academy**, a comprehensive collection of my teaching materials on reinforcement learning (RL), including research papers, textbooks with my annotations, my presentations, and an assignment delivered via Colab.

## Contents

-   **Teaching Materials**: Here you can find my personal take on reinforcement learning through 4 presentations that cover various RL topics.

-   **Colab Assignment**: This interactive assignment is designed to help you apply your theoretical knowledge of RL in a practical setting.

-   **Research Papers**: I've compiled a library of valuable papers covering well-known RL algorithms to provide a theoretical backdrop to the subject matter.

-   **Textbooks with Personal Annotations**: My recommended textbooks for deepening your RL knowledge. My annotations across these textbooks will guide you through the complex landscape of RL.
